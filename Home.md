Flow-Design is a visual data flow oriented approach to clean code development taught at the [Clean Code Developer School](http://ccd-school.de).

Although the visual language used to define software behavior through data processing pipelines is simple, students of our trainings often ask for a quick reference to the notational elements. This is what's provided here:
